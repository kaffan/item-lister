# item-lister
I have made an item-lister website using HTML, CSS and vanilla.js

HTML,CSS and Bootstarp
have been used in order to build the interface of the website

Vanilla.js
has been used in order to add functionality and events to the website

Web API -> LocalStorage 
has been used in order to save newly added items to the lists which can be retrieved when page is loaded. using this feature your previously added items are saved.
